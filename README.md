# Java-Turn-Based-RPG
A turn-based RPG demo I created in java using the model-view-controller architecture. I made this as a culmination of all I had learned in my programming paradigms class. Currently features a map editor, battle system, mana attacks, battle transformations, dialouge box, talking npcs, a save point, dynamic world layering, and much more.
